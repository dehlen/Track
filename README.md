<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/supports-Swift%20Package%20Manager-green.svg">

This packages implements abstraction to track user behaviour in your application. The concrete tracking implementation is provided by you or the provider you are using. You can track with multiple providers in parallel. 

## Installation

Currently only Swift Package Manager is supported. 
Swift Package Manager is a dependency manager built into Xcode.

If you are using Xcode 11 or higher, go to File / Swift Packages / Add Package Dependency... and enter package repository URL https://github.com/dehlen/Track.git, then follow the instructions.

To remove the dependency, select the project and open Swift Packages (which is next to Build Settings). You can add and remove packages from this tab.
